## Functionality Summary
    This Python script functions as a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs one of four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

## User Input:

    # The program first prompts the user to enter two numbers, num1 and num2.
    
    # It then asks the user to specify the operation they want to perform by entering one of the following symbols: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, or / for division.

## Performing the Operation:

     # The script uses an if-elif structure to check which operation the user has chosen.

     # Depending on the input, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:

           Addition (+): Adds num1 and num2.

           Subtraction (-): Subtracts num2 from num1.

           Multiplication (*): Multiplies num1 and num2.

           Division (/): Divides num1 by num2 if num2 is not zero. If num2 is zero, it prints an error message.


## Output:

    # After performing the selected operation, the result is printed out.

    # If division by zero is attempted, it prints "error".
